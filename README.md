<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Alena C.</h1>
<h3 align="center">aspiring full-stack developer and computer science student from Berlin</h3>

🔭 I’m currently working on building the portfolio and strengthening my hard skills. 

<h4 align="center">My Academic Projects in Data Analysis and Machine Learning include:</h4>

⚡**NYC Property Value Prediction** (working on publishing this paper)
Technologies: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), SQL, Tableau, Lasso Regression
-	Developed a predictive model using Lasso Regression to analyze real estate data, identifying critical factors affecting property prices.
Result: Improved prediction reliability by identifying critical price-determining variables, directly applicable to Siemens' SQL Server Data Services (SSDS) tasks.

⚡**Wine Quality Classification** (working on publishing this paper)
Technologies: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), Random Forest, SVM
-	Implemented Random Forest and SVM models to classify wine quality based on chemical properties, applying data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.
Result: Reached high classification accuracy, demonstrating expertise in machine learning and model optimization, which aligns with Siemens' focus on technical problem-solving in data analytics.

⚡**Salary Prediction Model**
Technologies: Python, Tableau, Linear & Polynominal Regression
-	Built regression models to predict salary trends based on demographics, visualizing insights in Tableau.
Result: Developed a model providing actionable insights for salary trends, showcasing data analysis capabilities relevant to Siemens’ SQL and data processing solutions.

⚡**SQL and Database Management Fundamentals**
Technologies: MySQL, SQL, Database Management Systems
-	Built and queried databases using MySQL Workbench, focusing on data retrieval, filtering, and relational data structuring in real-world applications.
Result: Enhanced ability to design and query relational databases, directly applicable to Siemens’ SQL Server and SSDS tasks.

⚡**Advanced Database Management Systems (DBMS) & Schema Design**
Technologies: MySQL, SQL, Database Design, UML
-	Applied advanced SQL techniques and database design principles, including normalization and indexing; created a library database schema with UML.
Result: Achieved practical experience in DBMS and database design, including hands-on SQL application, essential for supporting data operations in tech-driven environments.
